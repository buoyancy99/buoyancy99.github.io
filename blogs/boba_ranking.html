              <p>
                Many people underestimate the importance of boba when they
                choose grad school. For those who don't know what boba is, I
                have an entire blog that explains boba. In short, you can think
                of it as the coffee equivalent for east Asians. After learning a
                painful lesson when I moved to MIT last year, I decided to share
                my boba experience at different schools. Since I study computer
                science, I would call it â€˜best computer science schools ranked
                by boba'.
              </p>

              <h4>1. UC Berkeley</h4>
              <p>
                There is nowhere in the United States that's comparable to
                Berkeley in terms of boba. Within two blocks of the school
                entrance are twenty boba shops that feature all variants of boba
                you will find in an Asian country. If you think boba is just
                milk tea and tapioca pearls, all the available options in these
                boba shops will completely blow your mind. These are not even
                all the boba shops near UC Berkeley. In fact, its entire campus
                is surrounded by high quality boba shops! A ten minute walk
                would allow you to reach a boba shop from anywhere in the
                campus. Cory Hall, home to the school of engineering, is even
                built around the courtyard that houses a boba shop. When I was
                an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, I drank boba almost on
                a daily basis. Whenever students want to take a break from study
                or research, we hang out together by getting boba. In summer,
                grape aloe sago, sugar cane latte from Yifang or brown sugar
                boba from Feng Cha are always the best refreshments for me as
                well all. After pulling all-nighters for deadlines, I'd always
                get a cup of matcha latte with grass jelly from Asha Tea House
                to start an energetic afternoon. If boba is an important part of
                your life just like me, definitely go to Berkeley!
              </p>
              <h4>2. Stanford University</h4>
              <p>
                While Stanford is not as good as Berkeley in terms of boba, it
                still provides an authentic boba experience. There are several
                boba shops around the campus, all located in the most convenient
                locations. Wanpo Tea Shop and Zero& in the Stanford shopping
                mall are probably the best in Palo Alto. The famous boba shop
                from San Francisco, Boba Guys, also has a shop opened on the
                perimeter of the campus. (Although it's a more americanized boba
                place and many find it too sweet). It takes less than 10 minutes
                to bike from the Gates Computer Science building to these
                places. Considering the huge size of Stanford campus, these boba
                shops might be too far for those without a bike, however. If you
                are lucky to work or live in the outer ring of the campus, a
                short walk would be all you need. Due to the significant
                presence of Asian population in both Stanford and Palo Alto, all
                boba shops in the region are of decent quality so you will have
                even more options if you have a car. Stanford as a school also
                embraces the boba culture. During my stay at the school, I was
                surprised that baba is occasionally served in dining halls. If
                you love boba and wouldn't mind a short ride for high quality
                boba, Stanford would be a great place for you!

                The best way to make friends and get work done is to go to a
                boba shop and buy a drink. The next best way is to go to a boba
                shop and buy a drink for your friends.

              <h4>3. Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h4>
              <p>
                MIT would not be the first choice for boba lovers. While Boston
                has a lot of great boba shops, I would rate the boba scene in
                the Cambridge area as 2 out of 5 stars. The first and largest
                problem is that there is not enough volume of boba shops. While
                there are several boba shops in the city, they are not very
                accessible from the MIT campus. The most convenient boba one is
                at least a 20 minute walk away from the Computer Science and
                Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The second problem is that
                the quality is not always guaranteed. Every time I visit Moge
                Tea near Central Square, I find they either put in an excess
                proportion of tea or brew the tea too heavily. It's not really a
                boba shop in my opinion, since fruit slushies are the only
                reasonable options in the business. Some other boba shops are
                even worse, using powdered milk or artificial flavors instead of
                fresh ingredients. A good amount of people at MIT have a
                terrible taste of boba and would tell me they enjoy boba from
                these shops. While there are no good options in Cambridge, you
                can still find authentic boba shops in Boston if you are willing
                to ride a bike or take the subway. Zero& is the best boba place
                in Boston by far, and it takes 15 minutes of biking from MIT. My
                old favourite Yifang Taiwan Fruit Tea can be found too, although
                this branch in Boston has a much shorter menu compared to those
                in California. Traveling to Chinatown in Boston only takes 30
                minutes by walking. There you will find Tiger Sugar, the best
                brown sugar boba place I've ever visited. If you come to MIT, I
                would highly recommend you to live on the Boston side of the
                Charles River. You will still have a reasonable boba experience
                because of Yifang but afternoon boba hangouts near campus don't
                exist here.
              </p>
              <h4>4. Carnegie Mellon University</h4>
              <p>
                While I have not visited Carnegie Mellon yet, I would not
                recommend going to the school if you depend on boba for
                research. It is not easy to find authentic boba in a city like
                Pittsburgh. I have a lot of friends who study at CMU and they
                told me Fuku Tea is a mediocre boba place near campus. However,
                if you don't mind biking or driving a bit, Tsaocaa is an amazing
                boba place in the city of Pittsburgh. Other than that, I don't
                have much knowledge about the boba scene there. I really hope I`
                will be able to visit the city some day in the future so I can
                complete this review.
              </p>
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>
                While boba is not the most important factor to choose a graduate
                school, you should not underestimate the importance of boba in
                your daily life. After all, it's the boba that keeps you awake
                and energetic during your study and research. As a boba lover, I
                hope boba can also be a useful factor to choose your school. If
                you have any questions about boba, please feel free to ask me.
                I'll be happy to be your boba consultant.
